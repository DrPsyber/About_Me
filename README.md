# `About_Me`

## Welcome to **Zach Metteer's** source repo.  
> **Caution:** This repo is as it sounds, a long overdue data dump of what's in my brain, good and bad. You have been warned.

### Prologue
I have experienced many great things and gained a lot of knowledge during my 25+ year career in various sectors (Healthcare, Financial, Retail, Manufacturing in that order) under many capacities. I have held many titles, Sr. Software Engineer, Data Engineer, Developer, Tech Support Rep, heck at one point I was even a CNC Machinist.

I fealt compelled to share, it's not all going to be great, some not even useful, but maybe... just maybe, some part of my repo will ignite a spark in someone needing some inspiration while navigating this new world which at the time of writing this, is on the precipus of a giant shift, an explosion of intelligence and creativity. A true makers paradise... or the rise of the machines and downfall of humanity... I dunno, it kinda could go either way at this point. 

> **Note:** This will not happen overnight so please be patient, I will contribute as often as I can.

Lets get started by introducing you to professional me:
